Here’s how to implement **Data Storage in Redis** with examples for both **caching functionality** and **storing and retrieving data**:

---

### **a) Implement Caching Functionality Using Redis as a Cache Store**

#### **1. Set up Redis Cache**

To set up Redis as a cache, you typically store frequently accessed data in Redis to avoid querying the database repeatedly. Redis is fast and ideal for caching.

```bash
# Start Redis server (assuming Redis is already installed)
redis-server
```

#### **2. Store Data in Redis Cache**

Use `SET` command to store data in Redis.

```bash
# Store a string value for a cache key (e.g., user session)
SET "user:1001" "Alice"
```

Here, `"user:1001"` is the key, and `"Alice"` is the value.

#### **3. Set Expiry Time for Cache**

You can set an expiration time for a cache using the `EXPIRE` command to ensure the cache doesn’t stay forever.

```bash
# Set an expiry of 3600 seconds (1 hour) for the cache key
EXPIRE "user:1001" 3600
```

#### **4. Retrieve Cached Data**

To retrieve the cached value, use the `GET` command.

```bash
# Retrieve the value for the cache key 'user:1001'
GET "user:1001"
```

This will return `"Alice"` if the key still exists in the cache.

---

### **b) Store and Retrieve Data from Redis Cache Using Appropriate Commands**

#### **1. Store Data (Using `SET` Command)**

Store a user's details in a Redis hash for structured data.

```bash
# Storing multiple fields for user data
HSET "user:1001" "name" "Alice" "age" 30 "department" "HR"
```

This stores a Redis hash with fields `name`, `age`, and `department` under the key `user:1001`.

#### **2. Retrieve Specific Field from the Hash (Using `HGET` Command)**

Retrieve specific data from the hash.

```bash
# Retrieve 'name' field from user:1001 hash
HGET "user:1001" "name"
```

This will return `"Alice"`.

#### **3. Retrieve All Fields from the Hash (Using `HGETALL` Command)**

```bash
# Retrieve all fields from user:1001
HGETALL "user:1001"
```

This will return all fields in the hash for `user:1001`, such as:

```
1) "name"
2) "Alice"
3) "age"
4) "30"
5) "department"
6) "HR"
```

#### **4. Delete a Field from the Hash (Using `HDEL` Command)**

To delete a specific field from the hash:

```bash
# Delete 'department' field from the user:1001 hash
HDEL "user:1001" "department"
```

#### **5. Check If a Key Exists (Using `EXISTS` Command)**

Check if a particular key exists in the cache.

```bash
# Check if 'user:1001' exists in Redis cache
EXISTS "user:1001"
```

This will return `1` if the key exists, otherwise `0`.

#### **6. Increment/Decrement Values in Redis (Using `INCR`/`DECR` Command)**

Redis allows you to increment or decrement numbers stored as values.

```bash
# Increment 'age' by 1
HINCRBY "user:1001" "age" 1
```

This will increase the `age` field by 1 for the key `user:1001`.

#### **7. Remove Cache Data (Using `DEL` Command)**

You can delete a specific key from the Redis cache.

```bash
# Delete the user:1001 key from Redis cache
DEL "user:1001"
```

---

### **Summary of Redis Commands:**

1. **Set Data (Key-Value)**:
```bash
SET "user:1001" "Alice"
```

2. **Set Hash Data**:
```bash
HSET "user:1001" "name" "Alice" "age" 30 "department" "HR"
```

3. **Get Data**:
```bash
GET "user:1001"
```

4. **Get Specific Hash Field**:
```bash
HGET "user:1001" "name"
```

5. **Get All Fields in Hash**:
```bash
HGETALL "user:1001"
```

6. **Set Expiry for Cache**:
```bash
EXPIRE "user:1001" 3600
```

7. **Delete Specific Field from Hash**:
```bash
HDEL "user:1001" "department"
```

8. **Increment Field Value**:
```bash
HINCRBY "user:1001" "age" 1
```

9. **Check Key Existence**:
```bash
EXISTS "user:1001"
```

10. **Delete Key**:
```bash
DEL "user:1001"
```

These commands allow you to implement caching functionality and efficiently store/retrieve data in Redis.
