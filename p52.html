### **HBase Operations for the 'student' Table**

Let's walk through each of the operations in detail:

#### **1. Create Table with Two Column Families ('info' and 'grades')**
To create a table named `student` with column families `info` and `grades`:
```shell
create 'student', 'info', 'grades'
```

#### **2. Insert Data**
To insert the name "John Doe" into the `info:name` column for the corresponding row (assume row key is '1'):
```shell
put 'student', '1', 'info:name', 'John Doe'
```

#### **3. Get Student Information**
To retrieve all information for the student with ID '1' (John Doe):
```shell
get 'student', '1'
```

#### **4. Update Grade**
To update John Doe's math grade from 'B' to 'A' in the `grades:math` column:
```shell
put 'student', '1', 'grades:math', 'A'
```

#### **5. Get Specific Column**
To fetch only the name of the student with ID '1':
```shell
get 'student', '1', 'info:name'
```

#### **6. Scan Table**
To scan and display all rows (students) in the `student` table:
```shell
scan 'student'
```

#### **7. Get Multiple Rows**
To retrieve information for students with IDs '2' and '3':
```shell
get 'student', '2'
get 'student', '3'
```

#### **8. Delete Data**
To remove John Doe's name from the `info:name` column:
```shell
delete 'student', '1', 'info:name'
```

#### **9. Get All Columns in a Row**
To retrieve all columns for the student with ID '1':
```shell
get 'student', '1'
```

#### **10. Filter Data by Grade**
To find all students who scored 'A' in any subject (e.g., `grades:math`):
```shell
scan 'student', { FILTER => "SingleColumnValueFilter('grades', 'math', =, 'binary:A')" }
```

#### **11. Count Rows**
To count the total number of rows (students) in the `student` table:
```shell
count 'student'
```

#### **12. Get Latest Version of a Cell**
To get the most recent version of John Doe's name from the `info:name` column:
```shell
get 'student', '1', {COLUMN => 'info:name', VERSION => 1}
```

#### **13. Scan with Row Filter**
To scan and view information for students whose IDs start with '2':
```shell
scan 'student', {FILTER => "RowFilter(=, 'regexstring', '^2.*')" }
```

#### **14. Delete Entire Row**
To delete the entire row for the student with ID '2':
```shell
deleteall 'student', '2'
```

#### **15. Get Row with Maximum Version**
To retrieve the student with ID '1' but limited to the last two versions of the columns:
```shell
get 'student', '1', {VERSION => 2}
```

#### **16. Scan with Column Range**
To scan and view only the `info` and `grades` columns for all students:
```shell
scan 'student', {COLUMN => ['info', 'grades']}
```

#### **17. Filter Data by Name Prefix**
To find all students whose names start with "John":
```shell
scan 'student', {FILTER => "ValueFilter(=, 'regexstring', '^John.*')"}
```

#### **18. Get Timestamp of a Cell**
To retrieve the timestamp of John Doe's math grade in `grades:math` when it was last updated:
```shell
get 'student', '1', {COLUMN => 'grades:math', TIMESTAMP => true}
```

#### **19. Disable Table**
To temporarily disable the `student` table:
```shell
disable 'student'
```

#### **20. Enable Table**
To re-enable the `student` table after maintenance:
```shell
enable 'student'
```

#### **21. Drop Table**
To permanently delete the `student` table and all its data:
```shell
drop 'student'
```
