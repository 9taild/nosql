### **MongoDB Queries: Working with Employee and Department Collections**

#### **1. Create Database, Collections, and Insert Sample Data**

First, switch to the `company` database:
```js
use company
```

Create the `employee` and `department` collections:
```js
db.createCollection("employee")
db.createCollection("department")
```

Insert sample data into the `employee` collection (at least 10 rows):
```js
db.employee.insertMany([
    {
        "name": "Alice Johnson",
        "age": 30,
        "designation": "Software Developer",
        "departmentId": 1
    },
    {
        "name": "Bob Smith",
        "age": 35,
        "designation": "Database Administrator",
        "departmentId": 2
    },
    {
        "name": "Eva Davis",
        "age": 28,
        "designation": "UI/UX Designer",
        "departmentId": 1
    },
    {
        "name": "David Lee",
        "age": 40,
        "designation": "HR Manager",
        "departmentId": 3
    },
    {
        "name": "Grace Williams",
        "age": 50,
        "designation": "CEO",
        "departmentId": 4
    },
    {
        "name": "Henry Clark",
        "age": 32,
        "designation": "Software Engineer",
        "departmentId": 1
    },
    {
        "name": "Isabella Moore",
        "age": 29,
        "designation": "Marketing Specialist",
        "departmentId": 2
    },
    {
        "name": "Jack Harris",
        "age": 38,
        "designation": "Product Manager",
        "departmentId": 5
    },
    {
        "name": "Lily White",
        "age": 34,
        "designation": "Business Analyst",
        "departmentId": 4
    },
    {
        "name": "Mason King",
        "age": 45,
        "designation": "CTO",
        "departmentId": 5
    }
])
```

Insert sample data into the `department` collection (at least 5 rows):
```js
db.department.insertMany([
    {
        "name": "IT",
        "location": "New York"
    },
    {
        "name": "HR",
        "location": "Chicago"
    },
    {
        "name": "Finance",
        "location": "Los Angeles"
    },
    {
        "name": "Management",
        "location": "San Francisco"
    },
    {
        "name": "Marketing",
        "location": "Miami"
    }
])
```

#### **2. Perform the Queries**

1. **Retrieve all employees**:
```js
db.employee.find()
```

2. **Retrieve employees in a specific department (e.g., IT department)**:
```js
db.employee.find({"departmentId": 1})
```

3. **Retrieve all departments**:
```js
db.department.find()
```

4. **Retrieve employees older than 30 years**:
```js
db.employee.find({"age": {$gt: 30}})
```

5. **Retrieve employees sorted by age in ascending order**:
```js
db.employee.find().sort({"age": 1})
```

6. **Retrieve employees belonging to a specific department with their department details (using $lookup)**:
```js
db.employee.aggregate([
    {
        $lookup: {
            from: "department",
            localField: "departmentId",
            foreignField: "_id",
            as: "department_details"
        }
    }
])
```

7. **Retrieve employees sorted by department and age**:
```js
db.employee.aggregate([
    { $sort: { "departmentId": 1, "age": 1 } }
])
```

8. **Increment the age of all employees by 1 year**:
```js
db.employee.updateMany({}, { $inc: { "age": 1 } })
```

9. **Rename a department (e.g., rename "IT" department to "Information Technology")**:
```js
db.department.updateOne(
    { "name": "IT" },
    { $set: { "name": "Information Technology" } }
)
```

10. **Update an employee's information (e.g., update Bob Smith's age)**:
```js
db.employee.updateOne(
    { "name": "Bob Smith" },
    { $set: { "age": 36 } }
)
```

11. **Update a department's location (e.g., update IT department's location to "San Francisco")**:
```js
db.department.updateOne(
    { "name": "IT" },
    { $set: { "location": "San Francisco" } }
)
```

12. **Delete a specific employee by their ID**:
```js
db.employee.deleteOne({ "_id": ObjectId("employee_id_here") })
```

13. **Delete a specific department by its ID**:
```js
db.department.deleteOne({ "_id": ObjectId("department_id_here") })
```

14. **Delete employees older than 40 years**:
```js
db.employee.deleteMany({ "age": { $gt: 40 } })
```

15. **Delete employees not belonging to any department (where departmentId is null)**:
```js
db.employee.deleteMany({ "departmentId": null })
```

16. **Delete an employee (e.g., delete Alice Johnson from the employees)**:
```js
db.employee.deleteOne({ "name": "Alice Johnson" })
```

17. **Delete employees in a specific department (e.g., delete all employees in HR department)**:
```js
db.employee.deleteMany({ "departmentId": 2 })
```

18. **Delete a department (e.g., delete the HR department)**:
```js
db.department.deleteOne({ "name": "HR" })
```

### **Explanation of Operations**
- **InsertMany** is used to insert multiple documents into a collection at once.
- **$lookup** is used for **joins** between collections in MongoDB, allowing you to combine documents from two collections.
- **$inc** is used to increment a field (like age).
- **$set** is used to update a field with a new value.
- **$gt** is a comparison operator used to find values greater than a specified number.
- **deleteOne** and **deleteMany** are used to remove specific documents from the collection based on a condition.
