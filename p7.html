Here are some additional examples for **Implementing Indexing in MongoDB**:

---

### **a) Create an Index on a Specific Field in a MongoDB Collection**

#### **1. Index on Single Field**

To create an index on the `age` field for the `employee` collection:

```bash
# Create an ascending index on the 'age' field
db.employee.createIndex({ "age": 1 })
```

#### **2. Unique Index**

If you want to ensure that each `email` in the `employee` collection is unique, use a unique index:

```bash
# Create a unique index on the 'email' field
db.employee.createIndex({ "email": 1 }, { unique: true })
```

#### **3. Text Index**

To enable text search, you can create a text index on a field like `name`:

```bash
# Create a text index on the 'name' field
db.employee.createIndex({ "name": "text" })
```

This allows searching within the `name` field using text queries like `$text`.

#### **4. Geospatial Index**

To index geospatial data, for example, if the `location` field contains coordinates:

```bash
# Create a 2dsphere index on the 'location' field
db.employee.createIndex({ "location": "2dsphere" })
```

This is useful for queries involving geographical data, such as finding employees near a specific location.

---

### **b) Measure the Impact of Indexing on Query Performance**

#### **1. Query Without Index:**

Perform a query on the `employee` collection without an index, and measure the query execution time:

```bash
# Run a query on 'departmentId' without an index
db.employee.find({ "departmentId": 1 }).explain("executionStats")
```

This will provide execution stats like the number of documents scanned and the time taken.

#### **2. Query With Index:**

Now, create an index on the `departmentId` field and run the same query again:

```bash
# Create an index on the 'departmentId' field
db.employee.createIndex({ "departmentId": 1 })

# Run the query with the index
db.employee.find({ "departmentId": 1 }).explain("executionStats")
```

You should notice a decrease in the query execution time, as the index allows MongoDB to quickly locate matching documents.

#### **3. Index Usage with Compound Index:**

If you're performing queries on multiple fields, create a compound index. For example, on `departmentId` and `age`:

```bash
# Create a compound index on 'departmentId' and 'age'
db.employee.createIndex({ "departmentId": 1, "age": -1 })

# Query using both fields
db.employee.find({ "departmentId": 1, "age": { $gt: 30 } }).explain("executionStats")
```

Check the execution stats to see if the compound index improves performance.

#### **4. Use `$text` Query with Text Index:**

If you created a text index on the `name` field, you can perform text search queries:

```bash
# Perform a text search on the 'name' field
db.employee.find({ $text: { $search: "Alice" } }).explain("executionStats")
```

This query will search for documents containing the word "Alice" in the `name` field, and the text index will help speed up the query.

#### **5. Index Effect on Write Performance:**

While indexes improve read performance, they may slightly slow down writes because each index needs to be updated when data is inserted, updated, or deleted. To observe this:

```bash
# Insert a large number of documents without index
db.employee.insertMany([...])

# Create an index and measure the time to insert again
db.employee.createIndex({ "name": 1 })
db.employee.insertMany([...])
```

You can compare the time it takes to insert data before and after the index creation.

### **Summary of Commands for Indexing**

- **Create a Single Field Index:**
```bash
db.collection.createIndex({ "field": 1 })   # Ascending index
db.collection.createIndex({ "field": -1 })   # Descending index
```

- **Create a Unique Index:**
```bash
db.collection.createIndex({ "field": 1 }, { unique: true })
```

- **Create a Compound Index:**
```bash
db.collection.createIndex({ "field1": 1, "field2": -1 })
```

- **Create a Text Index:**
```bash
db.collection.createIndex({ "field": "text" })
```

- **Create a Geospatial Index:**
```bash
db.collection.createIndex({ "location": "2dsphere" })
```

- **Query Performance Without Index:**
```bash
db.collection.find({ "field": "value" }).explain("executionStats")
```

- **Query Performance With Index:**
```bash
db.collection.find({ "field": "value" }).explain("executionStats")
```

- **Text Search Query:**
```bash
db.collection.find({ $text: { $search: "keyword" } }).explain("executionStats")
```

######################################################
Here is the implementation of **Indexing in MongoDB** with the required steps:

---

### **1. Create a MongoDB Database Named ‘company’**

```bash
# Create a database named 'company'
use company
```

---

### **2. Create an Employee Collection with Attributes: {name, salary, department, position}**

```bash
# Create the 'employee' collection with sample data
db.employee.insertMany([
  { "name": "Alice", "salary": 60000, "department": "HR", "position": "Manager" },
  { "name": "Bob", "salary": 45000, "department": "Engineering", "position": "Developer" },
  { "name": "Charlie", "salary": 75000, "department": "Engineering", "position": "Developer" },
  { "name": "David", "salary": 55000, "department": "HR", "position": "Assistant" },
  { "name": "Eve", "salary": 90000, "department": "Engineering", "position": "Senior Developer" },
  { "name": "Frank", "salary": 50000, "department": "Sales", "position": "Salesperson" },
  { "name": "Grace", "salary": 80000, "department": "Engineering", "position": "Developer" }
])
```

---

### **3. Create an Index on the `salary` Field**

```bash
# Create an index on the 'salary' field in the employee collection
db.employee.createIndex({ "salary": 1 })
```

---

### **4. Search for Employees with a Salary Greater than 50,000 Without Using Indexes**

```bash
# Search without using an index (initial query will not use an index by default)
db.employee.find({ "salary": { $gt: 50000 } }).explain("executionStats")
```

This query will show the execution stats, and you should see that MongoDB performs a **COLLSCAN** (collection scan).

---

### **5. Search for Employees with a Salary Greater than 50,000 Using Indexes**

To explicitly use the created index, you can use the `hint()` method:

```bash
# Search using the 'salary' index
db.employee.find({ "salary": { $gt: 50000 } }).hint({ "salary": 1 }).explain("executionStats")
```

This query will show the execution stats, and you should see that MongoDB uses the **IXSCAN** (index scan).

---

### **6. Query to Find Employees in a Specific Department Using the `hint()` Method**

```bash
# Search for employees in the 'Engineering' department using index on salary
db.employee.find({ "department": "Engineering" }).hint({ "salary": 1 }).explain("executionStats")
```

The execution stats will indicate the use of the index to fetch employees, even though we're querying based on `department`.

---

### **7. Query to Find Employees with a Salary Range Using the `hint()` Method**

```bash
# Search for employees with a salary between 50,000 and 80,000
db.employee.find({ "salary": { $gt: 50000, $lt: 80000 } }).hint({ "salary": 1 }).explain("executionStats")
```

This query will show how the index optimizes the range query on the `salary` field.

---

### **8. Query to Find Employees with a Specific Position Using the `hint()` Method**

```bash
# Search for employees with the position 'Developer'
db.employee.find({ "position": "Developer" }).hint({ "salary": 1 }).explain("executionStats")
```

This query will optimize the search for employees in the `Developer` position using the salary index.

---

### **9. Query to Find Employees with a Specific Position Using the `hint()` Method**

This is the same as the previous query. To repeat:

```bash
# Search for employees with the position 'Manager'
db.employee.find({ "position": "Manager" }).hint({ "salary": 1 }).explain("executionStats")
```

This query shows how the index is used for searching employees in a specific position.

---

### **10. Query to Find Employees with a Salary Above a Threshold in a Specific Department Using the `hint()` Method**

```bash
# Search for employees with a salary above 60,000 in the 'Engineering' department
db.employee.find({ "salary": { $gt: 60000 }, "department": "Engineering" }).hint({ "salary": 1 }).explain("executionStats")
```

This query will show how the index on the `salary` field helps in efficiently fetching employees in the `Engineering` department with a salary above 60,000.

---

### **Summary of Commands:**

- **Create Index:**
```bash
db.employee.createIndex({ "salary": 1 })
```

- **Search Without Index:**
```bash
db.employee.find({ "salary": { $gt: 50000 } }).explain("executionStats")
```

- **Search Using Index:**
```bash
db.employee.find({ "salary": { $gt: 50000 } }).hint({ "salary": 1 }).explain("executionStats")
```

- **Search Employees by Department Using Index:**
```bash
db.employee.find({ "department": "Engineering" }).hint({ "salary": 1 }).explain("executionStats")
```

- **Search by Salary Range Using Index:**
```bash
db.employee.find({ "salary": { $gt: 50000, $lt: 80000 } }).hint({ "salary": 1 }).explain("executionStats")
```

- **Search by Position Using Index:**
```bash
db.employee.find({ "position": "Developer" }).hint({ "salary": 1 }).explain("executionStats")
```

- **Search Employees with Salary Above a Threshold in Specific Department Using Index:**
```bash
db.employee.find({ "salary": { $gt: 60000 }, "department": "Engineering" }).hint({ "salary": 1 }).explain("executionStats")
```

These queries allow you to see how indexing improves performance and how to use the `hint()` method in MongoDB for optimized query execution.
